# Onboarding

Welcome to **Ordak**. This guide gets you productive in under an hour with **Cursor**, **Supabase**, and our repo conventions.

---

## 0) Access & Prereqs

- **GitHub**: access to `bannoscakes/bannoscakes-ordak-ui`
- **Node**: v18+ (`node -v`)
- **npm**: v9+ (`npm -v`)
- **Supabase**: project URL + anon key + service role (for Edge only)
- **Shopify** (staging): store tokens + `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (if you run webhooks locally)

---

## 1) Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bannoscakes/bannoscakes-ordak-ui.git
cd bannoscakes-ordak-ui
npm install
2) Environment
Create a local env file and fill the values you have:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env.local
Required:

VITE_SUPABASE_URL

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

VITE_APP_URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173)

Edge-only (set in your local shell or Edge functions settings):

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

SHOPIFY_BANNOS_TOKEN, SHOPIFY_FLOURLANE_TOKEN

SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

Never commit secrets. Client uses anon key; Edge Functions use service role.

3) Run the App (dev)
bash
Copy code
npm run dev
# open the URL that Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173)
4) Migrations & DB (when you need the DB locally)
bash
Copy code
# apply migrations against your dev Supabase project
npx supabase migration up

# create a new migration when you change schema
npx supabase migration new <name>

# dev-only reset (never in prod)
npx supabase db reset
5) Cursor Workflow
Open the repo in Cursor

Add the /docs folder as Context so models follow our rules

Use the dev branch for daily work; open PRs to dev; after review merge to main

6) Branch & Commit Rules
Branches:

main → production (protected)

dev → integration/default

feature/<short-name> → short-lived

Conventional Commits (examples):

feat(ui): show unassigned counts

fix(rpc): prevent invalid stage transition

docs(ops): add incident runbook

If Husky is enabled, it will check commit messages and run quick lint/type checks.

7) Stage Model (how the app behaves)
Single enum stages: Filling → Covering → Decorating → Packing → Complete.

Filling starts at barcode print (handle_print_barcode) → sets filling_start_ts

Filling ends on scan (complete_filling) → sets filling_complete_ts → stage becomes Covering

Covering/Decorating end on scan; Packing has start scan and complete scan

Unassigned is not a stage: it’s assignee_id IS NULL for the current stage

Read more in:

docs/overview.md (big picture)

docs/rpc-surface.md (all RPCs)

docs/schema-and-rls.md (tables, RLS)

docs/data-flows.md (ingest, inventory, queues)

8) First Task (practice)
Add a small note to docs/overview.md (e.g., clarify a term)

Commit:

bash
Copy code
git add docs/overview.md
git commit -m "docs(overview): clarify <your note>"
git push -u origin dev
Open a PR from dev (or your feature branch) if required by the flow

9) Useful Commands
bash
Copy code
npm run dev         # start app
npm run build       # build app
npm run test        # run tests (if configured)
npx supabase migration up     # apply DB migrations
npx supabase functions deploy <name>  # deploy an Edge function
