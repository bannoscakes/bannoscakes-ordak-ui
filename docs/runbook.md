# Runbook (Production Incidents)

Practical, copy-pasteable steps to diagnose and recover.  
Stage model: **Filling → Covering → Decorating → Packing → Complete**.  
**Unassigned** is not a stage (it means `assignee_id IS NULL`).  
All mutations go through **SECURITY DEFINER RPCs**; clients are read-only via RLS.

---

## 0) Severity & Ownership

- **P1 – Production down / orders blocked**
  - Examples: webhook ingestion failing for both stores; scans can’t change stage; DB outage.
  - **Goal:** restore service quickly (temporary measures OK).  
- **P2 – Degraded**
  - Examples: worker backlog growing; one store failing webhooks; dashboard slow (>p95 300ms).
- **P3 – Minor**
  - Examples: a single RPC idempotency edge; one view slow for some users.

**On-call:** <add name> • **Escalation:** <add Slack channel>.

## 1) 10-Minute Triage Checklist

**A. What’s broken?**
- Can we **ingest** a test order? (staging)
- Can we **print** barcode and **scan** to complete Filling?
- Is the **dashboard/queue** loading?

**B. Quick signals**
```bash
# Webhook + worker signals (Edge logs / monitoring)
# replace with your provider’s log query if needed

# DB health (psql or SQL editor)
-- Worker backlog by status
select status, count(*) from public.work_queue group by status;

-- Oldest pending minutes
select coalesce(extract(epoch from (now()-min(created_at)))/60, 0) as oldest_min
from public.work_queue where status='pending';

-- Orders present? latest row timestamps
select max(created_at) from public.orders_bannos;
select max(created_at) from public.orders_flourlane;
C. Decide the lane

App/UI issue → roll back app first.

Edge/webhook issue → pause webhooks, fix HMAC/secrets, replay.

DB/migrations → compensate/restore path below.

2) P1 – App/UI Rollback (DB healthy)
Communicate in Slack: “P1 investigating – app” (timestamp + symptoms).

Rollback app code:

bash
Copy code
git revert <bad-commit-or-tag>
npm run deploy:prod
Smoke (staging or prod if safe): queue loads, print barcode, complete Filling, start/complete Packing.

Watch Sentry/Slack for 15–30 min.

Post update in Slack (resolved + follow-ups).

3) P1 – Edge/Webhook Failure
Typical causes: bad SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET, wrong store token, route disabled.

Freeze amplification

Disable the webhook route temporarily (Shopify will retry later).

Verify

Check provider logs for POST /webhook/orders/create error codes.

In Shopify Admin → Webhooks → Recent deliveries (see error messages).

Fix

Verify secrets:

SHOPIFY_BANNOS_TOKEN, SHOPIFY_FLOURLANE_TOKEN

SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET

Redeploy the Edge function after updating secrets.

Recover

Re-enable route.

In Shopify Admin replay failed deliveries.

Sanity

Ingest a test order end-to-end; confirm orders_* tables updated.

4) P1 – DB / Migration Problem
Freeze writes

Disable webhook routes.

Announce read-only (if needed).

Compensate if possible

Prefer forward compensation: add back dropped columns as nullable; avoid destructive down in prod.

Restore path (PITR)

Pick a timestamp before incident (UTC).

Supabase: Restore to a new project at that time.

Point staging env to the restored DB → run smoke tests / sanity SQL:

sql
Copy code
select 'bannos' as store, count(*) from public.orders_bannos
union all
select 'flourlane', count(*) from public.orders_flourlane;
Cut over production: update VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY; rotate keys; redeploy.

Re-enable webhooks and replay; monitor Sentry/Slack 30–60 min.

(Full details in backup-recovery.md.)

5) Worker Backlog / Inventory Not Updating
Symptoms: work_queue growing or oldest_min > 15.

Inspect

sql
Copy code
select status, count(*) from work_queue group by status;
select coalesce(extract(epoch from (now()-min(created_at)))/60,0) as oldest_min
from work_queue where status='pending';

-- Stuck locks > 15 min
select * from work_queue
where status='pending' and locked_at < now() - interval '15 min';
Remediate

Increase concurrency / instance count for the worker.

Unlock stuck rows (use carefully):

sql
Copy code
update work_queue set locked_at=null, locked_by=null
where status='pending' and locked_at < now() - interval '15 min';
Backoff tune: ensure exponential; cap retries.

Reconcile job if ATS drift is suspected.

6) Stage/RPC Issues
Invalid stage errors:

Confirm current stage and call the correct RPC order:

Filling: handle_print_barcode → complete_filling

Covering: complete_covering

Decorating: complete_decorating

Packing: start_packing → complete_packing

QC return: qc_return_to_decorating (from Packing; admin from Complete if policy allows).

Idempotency

Re-prints/scans should return already_done=true and not move timestamps backward.

7) Assignment / “Unassigned” Cards Wrong
Definition: Unassigned = assignee_id IS NULL for the row’s current stage.

Check

sql
Copy code
-- Counts by stage (example for Bannos)
select stage, count(*) from public.orders_bannos
where assignee_id is null and stage <> 'Complete'
group by stage order by stage;
If counts differ from UI, check the UI query / RPC (get_unassigned_counts, get_unassigned_list).

8) Monitoring & Alerts (quick)
Queue p95 > 300ms for 5 min → investigate slow RPC/DB.

Webhook 5xx > 1% over 10 min or repeated store failures → verify secrets and route.

Worker backlog > 500 or oldest > 15 min → scale worker + unlock policy.

LCP p75 > 3s → front-end regression.

(Thresholds and dashboards in performance-slas.md.)

9) Comms Templates
Start

Mitigation

Mitigating by <action>. ETA for verification <time>.

Resolved

Resolved at <time>. Root cause: <short>. Follow-ups: <1-3 bullets with owners+dates>.

10) After Action

Appendix – Handy SQL
sql
Copy code
-- Orders by stage (both stores example)
select 'bannos' store, stage, count(*) from public.orders_bannos group by stage
union all
select 'flourlane', stage, count(*) from public.orders_flourlane group by stage;

-- Latest successful stage events (if used)
select order_id, action, at from public.stage_events order by at desc limit 50;
