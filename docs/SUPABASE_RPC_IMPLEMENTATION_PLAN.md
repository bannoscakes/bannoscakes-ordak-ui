# Supabase RPC Implementation Plan
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2025-01-30  
**Status:** In Progress

## üéØ Overview
Complete implementation of all RPC functions as defined in `rpc-surface.md`. Each RPC will be implemented in small, testable pieces with feature branches for safety.

## üìã Implementation Strategy
- **Small Pieces**: Each RPC group = 1 feature branch
- **Test First**: Each branch tested before merging to dev
- **Incremental**: Build on previous work, don't break existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Update docs as we go
