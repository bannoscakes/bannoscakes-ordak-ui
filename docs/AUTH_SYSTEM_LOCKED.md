# Authentication System - LOCKED ✅

## Status: WORKING AND LOCKED

The authentication system is working correctly and should NOT be modified.

### Key Components:
- ✅ `src/lib/auth.ts` - Real AuthService implementation
- ✅ `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Connected to real authService (NOT mock)
- ✅ `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - AuthProvider wrapper
- ✅ `src/components/Auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Login form

### Critical Files That Should NOT Be Modified:
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Must import from `../lib/auth` and use `authService.subscribe()`
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Contains the working AuthService implementation
- `src/App.tsx` - Contains the single URL architecture routing

### What Was Broken:
The `useAuth` hook was using a mock implementation that always returned:
- `loading: false`
- `user: null`
- Mock functions that just logged to console

This prevented authentication from working.

### What Was Fixed:
- Connected `useAuth` hook to real `authService` from `lib/auth.ts`
- Used `authService.subscribe()` for state changes
- Bound all auth methods to the real service

### Test Credentials:
- **Admin**: `info@flourlane.com.au`
- **Supervisor**: `josephsaliba533@gmail.com`
- **Staff**: `maria.angelaa4303@gmail.com`

### Single URL Architecture:
- All users access: `http://localhost:3000`
- Role-based interface switching (not URL-based)
- No role-specific URLs (`/staff`, `/supervisor`, `/admin`)

## ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY AUTH FILES WITHOUT VERIFICATION ⚠️

The authentication system is working and locked. Any changes to auth files should be thoroughly tested before committing.
